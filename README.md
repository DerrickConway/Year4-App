# Year4-App
Unity App


## Project Background and Description

I have been giving a game to make in 2D using unity. The game that has been giving to me is a maze running game.
I have been giving the documentation of the game and design spec to review and consult with the client.

## Project Scope

I now have a design for the game. The next step is to implement this game building all the assets and prefabs from the ground-up. This is an exercise in coding, not one in collecting assets from the assets store and compiling them into a game. Use the UI classes available in Unity to build the menus and displays for the game. The game must have the following components present:

 • Menu System – Splash Screen, Introduction, Preferences, Scores, Tutorials
 
 • Scoring System – A score/rewards system with different score values for different enemies, items or tasks that the player must deal with
 
 • Multiple Levels – Player competence and confidence in the game must be challenged with new levels of increasing difficulty. These should have been documented in the design phase.
 
 • Sound System – Appropriate sounds and music must be incorporated. You do not need to compose the music. You can import a piece, but it should work with the game.
 
 • Social Aspect – Sharing of high score on Facebook or other social media sites. Use the appropriate APIs for this aspect.

## Unity
For this I researched unity and how to use it as I have never used unity before for a project, so this was all new to me I found a lot of helpful tutorials on YouTube on how to install it and use my way around it. Unity is a cross-platform game engine developed by Unity Technologies, first announced and released in June 2005 at Apple Inc.'s Worldwide Developers Conference as an OS X-exclusive game engine. As of 2018, the engine has been extended to support 27 platforms. The engine can be used to create both three-dimensional and two-dimensional games as well as simulations for its many platforms.
